Examples of controversial outputs included Holocaust denial and calls for genocide using racial slurs. Within 16 hours of its release, Microsoft suspended the Twitter acount, deleted the offensive tweets, and stated that Tay had suffered from a \"coordinated attack by a subset of people\" that \"exploited a vulnerability.\" Tay was briefly and accidentally re-released on March 30 during testing, after which it was permanently shut down.
